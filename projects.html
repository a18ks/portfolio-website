            <h1>Simon-game</h1>
            <p>Simon is a memory-based electronic game where players are required to repeat a sequence of lights and sounds in the correct order. The game begins with a simple pattern, and each round, the sequence gets longer, challenging the player to remember and replicate it. The sequence is shown by flashing colored buttons, each producing a unique sound. Players must press the buttons in the same order as shown to continue. If the player presses an incorrect button, the game ends. Simon helps enhance memory, focus, and reaction time, making it a fun and engaging challenge.</p>
